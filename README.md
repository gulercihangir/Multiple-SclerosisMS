# Multiple-SclerosisMS
I developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze demographic, clinical, and MRI data from 273 patients to predict Multiple Sclerosis (MS) prognosis risk.
In this project, I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to forecast Multiple Sclerosis (MS) prognosis risk using a dataset of 273 patients containing demographic information, early-life factors, electrophysiological test results (LLSSEP, ULSSEP, VEP, BAEP), MRI lesion locations (periventricular, cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord), and clinical indicators such as initial symptoms and oligoclonal bands 

Multiple-SclerosisMS

I began by loading and inspecting the dataset, analyzing data types, summary statistics, and missing values, and identified substantial missingness in EDSS progression scores, which I excluded from modeling to avoid bias. I then created a binary target variable representing low vs high risk prognosis and conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis, including distribution plots, boxplots by risk group, categorical risk-rate comparisons, correlation heatmaps, and group-based statistical summaries to understand feature behavior. After defining numerical and categorical feature sets, I built a structured preprocessing pipeline using scikit-learn with median imputation and standard scaling for numerical variables, and mode imputation with one-hot encoding for categorical variables. I split the data using a stratified train-test approach to preserve class balance and trained two classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. I evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC curves, with both models achieving strong performance (ROC-AUC = 0.89 and accuracy = 78%). Finally, I analyzed feature importances from the Random Forest model, which revealed that periventricular and MRI lesions, initial symptom severity, age, schooling level were among the strongest predictors of high-risk progression. This project strengthened my ability to handle medical data, implement reproducible ML pipelines, compare models rigorously, and interpret predictive factors in a healthcare context, while remaining mindful that the work is for research and educational purposes only.
